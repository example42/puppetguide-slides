# What is Puppet?

Puppet is an Open Source **Configuration Management** software developed by [Puppet Labs](http://www.puppetlabs.com)

More widely Puppet is a framework for **Systems Automation** since it automates the configuration and ongoing management of our servers, in a centrally managed way.

It allows to define, with a **declarative** Domain Specific Language (**DSL**), what we want to configure and manage on an Operating System (OS): packages to install, services to start, files to configure and any system resource we can map and express in Puppet language.

Puppet works on Linux, Unix (Solaris, AIX, \*BSD), MacOS, Windows ([List of Supported Platforms](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/platforms.html)) and can be used also to configure network and storage devices or manage cloud resources.

It is used by [many companies](http://puppetlabs.com/customers/companies/) with a number of managed systems than ranges from few dozens to several thousands.

Puppet Labs releases also [Puppet Enterprise](https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise) (**PE**) based on the [Open Source code base](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) and oriented to enterprises that need official support and want Puppet infrastructure easier to setup and with better reporting and management features.
