# Practice: Language Basics

On a test machine **install Puppet** if not already installed.

Practice with the **commands**:

    puppet describe
    puppet resource
    facter

Create a **manifest** file and in that file manage the installation of the package and the management of the service of *nginx*.

Use ```puppet apply``` to apply the resources declared in our manifest.
