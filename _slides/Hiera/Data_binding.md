# Puppet 3 data bindings
With Puppet 3 Hiera is shipped directly with Puppet and an automatic hiera lookup is done for each class' parameter using the key **$class::$argument**: this functionality is called data bindings or automatic parameter lookup.

For example in a class definition like:

    @@@puppet
    class openssh (
      template = undef,
    ) { . . . }

Puppet 3 automatically looks for the Hiera key openssh::template if no value is explitely set when declaring the class.

To emulate a similar behaviour on pre Puppet 3 we should write something like:

    @@@puppet
    class openssh (
      template = hiera("openssh::template"),
    ) { . . . }

If a default value is set for an argument that value is used only when user has not explicitly declared value for that argument and Hiera automatic lookup for that argument doesn't return any value.
