# What is Puppet?

Puppet is an Open Source **Configuration Management** software developed by the [Puppet](http://www.puppet.com) company.

More widely Puppet is a framework for **Systems Automation** since it automates the configuration and ongoing management of our servers, in a centrally managed way.

It allows to define, with a **declarative** Domain Specific Language (**DSL**), what we want to configure and manage on an IT infrastructure: from components of an Operating System (OS) like packages, services to and files to network, cloud, storage resources.

Puppet agent can be installed on Linux, Unix (Solaris, AIX, \*BSD), MacOS, Windows ([List of Supported Platforms](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/system_requirements.html#reference-2673)) and can be used also to remotely configure network and storage devices or manage cloud resources.

It is used by [many companies](http://puppet.com/customers/companies/) with a number of managed systems than ranges from few dozens to several thousands.

Puppet releases also [Puppet Enterprise](https://puppet.com/puppet/puppet-enterprise) (**PE**) based on the [Open Source code base](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet) and oriented to enterprises that need official support and want Puppet infrastructure easier to setup and with better reporting and management features.
