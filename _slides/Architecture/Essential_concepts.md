# Essential Puppet concepts

A review of Puppet essential concepts. Check online the complete official [glossary](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/glossary.html).

- A typical Puppet setup is based on a client-server architecture: the client is also called **agent** (or **agent node** or simply **node**), the server is called **master**.
- When the puppet client connects to the server, it sends it's own ssl **certname** and a list of **facts** (units of information about the client's system generated by the command **facter**).
- Based on the client **certname** and its facts, the master replies with a **catalog** that describes what has to be configured on the client.
- The catalog is based on Puppet language (a Domain Specific Language, DSL), which is written in **manifests** (files with **.pp** extension).
- Puppet can also run in **masterless** mode, on the node the  **puppet apply** command parses directly a given manifest.
- In the manifests, using Puppet DSL, we declare **resources** that affect elements of the system (files, packages, services ...).
- Resources are grouped in **classes** which may expose **parameters** that affect their behavior.
- The values of the class parameters can be defined in different ways, one of them is **Hiera**.
- **Hiera** is a very common and versatile tool to store the values of parameters.
- Classes and the configuration files that are shipped to nodes are organized in **modules**.
