# Introduction to PuppetDB
PuppetDB is a "fast, scalable and reliable" data warehouse for Puppet.

It saves data generated by Puppet: nodes' **facts**, **catalogs** and **reports**.

It can also work as a performant backend for **exported resources** being a recommended alternative to the older ActiveRecord storeconfigs interface.

It provides a faster backend also for Puppet's **Inventory Service**.

PuppetDB is [opensource](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb), written in Clojure (it requires >= JDK 1.6 and PuppetMasters with Puppet >= 2.7.12), and is delivered as an autonomous software.

The best source from where to retrieve it are the official [Puppetlabs repositories](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/puppetlabs_package_repositories.html#open-source-repositories).
